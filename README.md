### Undergraduate Student in IPE at BUET

---

I am an ambitious **Undergraduate Student in Industrial & Production Engineering (IPE) at BUET**. My focus is on developing a strong, analytical foundation in both core engineering principles and computational thinking.

This profile is dedicated to documenting the technical skills, projects, and learning progress that define my journey as a student and systems thinker.

## 📚 My Technical Foundation

I am actively building foundational skills essential for industrial design, analysis, and automation:

* **Engineering Design:** **CAD (Computer-Aided Design)** for Product Design, fundamental Process Modeling.
* **Core Programming:** C, C++, and **Basic Web Development** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
* **Simulation & Logic:** Unity Game Engine

### Project Showcase: Guessing Cricket

My project, **Guessing Cricket**, serves as an excellent demonstration of my ability to build structured logic and self-contained systems—skills directly applicable to IPE modeling and automation.
